## The Challenge

As the Department of Defense (DoD) pursues a primary focus on innovating and defending against China, modernizing warfighting systems has never been more critical. Military decision-makers and systems operators at Air Operations Centers (AOC) have used the same Command and Control (C2) systems for decades, such as the Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS) 10.1; fielded in 2000 with few upgrades since its inception. This legacy system is deployed to AOCs in support of major operations and is now older than some of its end users. The main challenges associated with TBMCS are excessive system complexity, reliability and outage concerns, and system integration.

## The Opportunity

Legacy systems and resultant problems drive Raft’s development and support of the software modernization mission underway in Kessel Run’s Enterprise Developer/Designer Operations Requirement (EnDOR).

## Raft’s Approach

The solution to the outdated TBMCS is Kessel Run’s All Domain Operations Suite (KRADOS). Rafters are currently embedded across 22 different application teams and working in all three product lines within the EnDOR mission.
Raft’s software developers and UX designers are working in KRADOS cloud-based software suite throughout the EnDOR mission to continue to create, modernize, iterate, and maintain these applications. This suite resides on a cloud system to mitigate location-specific electronic attacks by adversaries and allow for identical operations systems across multiple AOCs to improve usability across the Air Force.

The Raft solution is an iterative suite of products, constantly evolving for the needs of the warfighter and decision-maker. KRADOS is deployed on IL6 cloud infrastructure and will be enhanced for multi-tenancy use for warfighters and decision-makers across all domains.

Under the EnDOR mission, Raft software developers and UX designers are pivotal to the modernization efforts under all three product lines at Kessel Run.
