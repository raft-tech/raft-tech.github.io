about: Aiden is an open-source enthusiast, aspiring self-hoster, and highly proficient baker to satisfy his sweet tooth. He grew up in northern New York by the Adirondacks and never moved far away - three hours west to Cornell University for college, and then three hours east to Boston where he worked to improve the healthcare space. Aidan is now back in NY, enjoying the rural privacy with his extended family pod.
