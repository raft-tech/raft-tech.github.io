about: Aaron is a Full Stack Engineer, who got his started creating 3d models with tools like 3ds max and ZBrush for video games. He got bored, and started writing code for games, and managed to continue to find enough new material he didn't get bored with it. Now he is a software generalist, casting a wide net, with a particular interest in artificial intelligence and the notion of emulating thought in a machine, to create a user experience capable of its own intuition. He is always seeking a challenge.
