about: Stumbling into the software development world more than 10 years ago by chance, Le is as curious and passionate about discovering development technologies and techniques today as he was when he wrote his first if statement. Since his first foray into this career, he has amassed a wide range of knowledge from frameworks such as React, Angular, and Spring; to technologies such as Kafka, Redis, and Docker. Outside of software development, he enjoys spending time with family and friends; and pretending to play tennis, and pool.
