about: Edward is a software engineer with experience building distributed processing systems, which is where he first learned about Kubernetes. Since then, he has gravitated to it as a means to build scalable, fault-tolerant architectures. He is also fascinated by the intersection between software and the physical world (cyber-physical systems), and counts Rust, Go, and C as a few of his favorite languages. Outside of engineering, Edward enjoys running, watching hockey, and attempting to cook.
