          <p>
            Decentralized approaches that leverage data “as is” and “where it
            is” match the complexity of the DoD’s heterogeneous data landscape.
            We weave together data fabric, data mesh, and data lakehouse design
            patterns to implement federated data ecosystems to unify data
            governance, democratize data access and use, and enable data
            integration and sharing from the enterprise to the edge.

            building vendor and cloud-agnostic CI/CD pipelines for the DoD and
            U.S. government's premier software factories. Today, we integrate
            least trust security into platform operations and architect
            automated solutions for airgapped environments, cross-domain
            ecosystems, and the contested edge.
