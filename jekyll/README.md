## Add yourself to the About page (Non Devs)

Welcome to Raft! We work together to solve hard problems and we're glad you've decided to join our journey. In order for you to be added to [Our Team](https://goraft.tech/about/#team) page, please follow these four steps:
0. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/raft-tech/raft-tech.github.io/issues/new) with title `Adding <your name>`

1. Create a new branch from `master`
2. Update the `_data/members.yml` to add your details and add a new file to the `_about/` folder
3. Send a Pull Request from your newly created branch in (1) to `master` and tag `barakstout`, `meissadia`, or `omnipresent07` as reviewers

Below is a detailed explanation of each step:

### 0 - Opening a new issue

- ![Opening GitHub Issue](https://i.imgur.com/SQ6nnzw.png)

### 1 - Creating a new branch

- Go to this URL - <https://github.com/raft-tech/raft-tech.github.io>
- Click master, type a unique branch name, and click `Create Branch`
- ![Create Branch](https://i.imgur.com/eS4Qaup.png)

- Scroll all the way to the bottom of the file and copy/paste the following:

```yaml
- id: firstname_lastname
  permalink: /about/firstname_lastname
  full_name: Firstname Lastname
  role: Your Title
  image: <firstname_lastname.jpg> or null (if you don't want your image up)
```

- Once pasted, change the contents
- Add details at the bottom of the page (Ensure the changes are going to correct branch and click `Commit Changes`)
- ![Commit Changes](https://i.imgur.com/0o5aH3N.png)
- Now similarly go to `_about` folder and create a new file

permalink: "/about/firstname_lastname"
full_name: Firstname Lastname
title: About - Firstname Lastname
role: Your Title
about: Short bio about yourself
github: your github handle
linkedin: yourlinkedin url
homepage: your homepage url - if applicable

- Ensure the commits are going into `staging` from `your branch` and the number of files changed is still 2
- Tag `barakstout`, `meissadia`, or `omnipresent07` as reviewers
- The reviewers will review and merge your Pull Request. Once that is done, the changes will show up on the staging site <https://raft-website.herokuapp.com/> . Once the changes look good to the reviewer, the reviewer will open a Pull Request for the `staging` branch to be merged into the `master`. Once that Pull Reuqest is merged in by the reviewer, the changes will show up on the main website - <http://goraft.tech/>

## Adding yourself to the About page (For Devs)

- Make your feature branch
- Append changes to `_data/members/yml`

```yaml
- id: firstname_lastname
  permalink: /about/firstname_lastname
  full_name: Firstname Lastname
  role: Title
  image: firstname_lastname.jpg or null if you don't want your image up
```

permalink: "/about/firstname_lastname"
full_name: Firstname Lastname
title: About - Firstname Lastname
role: Your title
about: Your Bio
github: "Your GitHub URL"
linkedin: "Your Linkedin URL"
featimg: "/assets/aboutBanner1.jpg" <-- do not change
layout: about/profile <--  do not change
---
```

- If you wanted to add your image, title it `firstname_lastname.jpg` and put it in `assets/profiles/`
- Open a PR for your feature branch to be merged to `staging`. Review your PR. Tag `barakstout`, `meissadia`, or `omnipresent07` as reviewers.

## Creating a blog post (Non Devs)

A blog post comprises for three things:

1. Have your blog post in Markdown format - We recommend <https://hackmd.io>. Copy/Paste the below into the editor.

    ```yaml
    ---
    layout: post
    title: "Really long blog title"
    short_title: "Shorter title"
    date: 2021-07-14
    categories:
    featimg: /assets/images/featimage/...
    bgimg: /assets/images/bgimg/...
    author: Angela Milash
    ---
    ```

2. Open [a new issue](https://github.com/raft-tech/raft-tech.github.io/issues/new)
    - (a) The title of the issue should be `Name of the blog title - by John Doe`
    - (b) The body of the ticket drag and drop the two images -- one for the [index page](https://goraft.tech/blog/) and another for the actual blog page (exampel: [here](https://goraft.tech/2021/02/24/diversity-is-our-superpower.html)). Also include the URL of the blog post from HackMD from ()
3. Click `Submit New Issue`
