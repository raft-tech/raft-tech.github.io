Activities include - Ethnographic study, Stakeholder interviews/workshops, Sector and competitor analysis, Journey mapping, Usability testing, Heuristic analysis.

Whether we’re creating User Interfaces from scratch, or redesigning existing products, our team of UX designers are fluent in translating a client’s needs into an easy, intuitive user experience. 
  experience3:  
    head: Content
    text: Our clients work hard to create a professional public-facing image for their organization, so we work hard to emulate that experience in our products. Our content strategies guide users to take natural behaviors that align with our client’s end goals using established best practices, accessible plain language, and highly measured interaction.
  experience4: 
    head: Development
    text: No two software builds are the same, which is why our development processes are based on flexible microservices-based architecture. As true Agile evangelists, our developers are adaptable; quick to pivot, yet experienced enough to build secure, stable platforms that scale past the projected life of the product. We are proponents of open source and resist vendor lock-in.
